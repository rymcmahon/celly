# Celly

Celly is a Ruby wrapper for the NHL Stats API, a little-known, undocumented API maintained by the National Hockey League. Celly aims to provide an easy-to-use DSL for making requests to the NHL Stats API and retrieving data about Teams, Players, Schedules, and Standings.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    $ gem 'celly'

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install celly

## Usage

Celly has six classes (as of now)â€”Player, Leaders, Scores, Team, Standings, and Schedule. Using the gem is a simple as instantiating a class and calling the available methods.

For example, to get a player's profile...
```ruby
player = Celly::Player.new

player.profile(8478402)
=> {:status=>"200", :message=>"OK", :data=>[{"id"=>8478402, "fullName"=>"Connor McDavid", "link"=>"/api/v1/people/8478402", "firstName"=>"Connor", "lastName"=>"McDavid", "primaryNumber"=>"97", "birthDate"=>"1997-01-13", "currentAge"=>24, "birthCity"=>"Richmond Hill", "birthStateProvince"=>"ON", "birthCountry"=>"CAN", "nationality"=>"CAN", "height"=>"6' 1\"", "weight"=>193, "active"=>true, "alternateCaptain"=>false, "captain"=>true, "rookie"=>false, "shootsCatches"=>"L", "rosterStatus"=>"Y", "currentTeam"=>{"id"=>22, "name"=>"Edmonton Oilers", "link"=>"/api/v1/teams/22"}, "primaryPosition"=>{"code"=>"C", "name"=>"Center", "type"=>"Forward", "abbreviation"=>"C"}}]}
```

...or to get a team's stats:

```ruby
team = Celly::Team.new

team.stats(7)
=> {:status=>"200", :message=>"OK", :data=>[{"type"=>{"displayName"=>"statsSingleSeason", "gameType"=>{"id"=>"R", "description"=>"Regular season", "postseason"=>false}}, "splits"=>[{"stat"=>{"gamesPlayed"=>15, "wins"=>5, "losses"=>8, "ot"=>2, "pts"=>12, "ptPctg"=>"40.0", "goalsPerGame"=>2.333, "goalsAgainstPerGame"=>3.0, "evGGARatio"=>0.6, "powerPlayPercentage"=>"32.6", "powerPlayGoals"=>16.0, "powerPlayGoalsAgainst"=>8.0, "powerPlayOpportunities"=>49.0, "penaltyKillPercentage"=>"75.8", "shotsPerGame"=>30.0667, "shotsAllowed"=>28.5333...]}
```
